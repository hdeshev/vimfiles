The files in this directory are used for storing customizations to
gVim Portable other than those in the files _vimrc and _viminfo.

Custom colorschemes, compilers, syntax files, etc. can go in here;
use the same directory structure as you do in App\vim\vimXX
(e.g. App\vim\vim72\colors\PortableApps.com.vim would become
      Data\settings\vimfiles\colors\PortableApps.com.vim).

Do NOT store your customisations in the App directory, otherwise they
will be lost when you upgrade gVim Portable.
