Hristo Deshev's Vim configuration. Stuff I use:

 * PowerShell syntax, indent and ftype
 * NERDTree
 * bufexplorer
 * matchit

I prever to run Vim portable on Windows, so that I don't have to go through an installation on a new machine.

I "redirect" my default _vimrc/.vimrc to the one in ~/vimfiles/_vimrc by adding a single source call:

source ~/vimfiles/_vimrc
